RUNNING THE SERVICE

The service consists of a frontend server, a way server, a relation server, and a set of node servers.

* front/rest.py <servers.conf> starts the frontend server
	** servers.conf tells the frontend where to find the other servers and on what ports to communicate
* waybox/ready_go.py starts the way server
* relationbox/ready_go.py starts the relation server
* nodebox/ready_go.py <port> starts a node server
